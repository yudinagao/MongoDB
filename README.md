# About MongoDB
MongoDB MongoDB is a document and a NoSQL database. Instead of storing data in tables of rows or columns like SQL databases, each record in a MongoDB database is a document, And you store the data in a non-relational way. 
Documents are associative arrays like JSON objects or Python dictionaries. For example, a student document representing a studentâ€™s first name, last name, email address, and ID. MongoDB documents of similar type are grouped into a collection. Our campus management system stores all student records or documents in the Students collection. And similarly, all staff documents are stored in the Employees collection.
Being a document database, MongoDB also allows you to store sub-documents to group secondary information together. It also supports lists of values. Not just text, but even different kinds mixed together. Working with MongoDB is easy because you can focus on the data you are writing and how you are going to read it. 
Traditional relational databases required you to create the schema first, then create table structures that will hold your data. So, if you decide to store an additional field, you will then have to alter your tables. 
In MongoDB, you change as you go along. MongoDB also gives you the power to bring in any structured or unstructured data. MongoDB also provides high availability by keeping multiple copies of your data, which we will cover in later topics. You can design complex data structures easily in MongoDB without worrying about the complexity of how it is stored and how it should be linked. 
Scalability provided by MongoDB means as your data needs grow, you can easily scale vertically, by introducing bigger, faster, better hardware, or horizontally, by partitioning your data. All of that can be done whether you are running a self-managed on-premises MongoDB, or the hybrid or cloud hosted and fully managed services such as IBM Cloud Databases for MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
